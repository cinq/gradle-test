Note:

If you use the default gradle that intall with fc17 you only have gradle 1.0 which gives you this error when you try to test:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[mc@inspiron gradle-test]$ gradle test
Dynamic properties are deprecated: http://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.ExtraPropertiesExtension.html
Deprecated dynamic property: "exceptionFormat" on "root project 'gradle-test'", value: "full".
...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need gradle 1.6 for this example to properly work.
I found this reference usefull http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/
